    <p>Paragraf. This one make a good space between this previous and next text.
        From now a'll white only to do a big or medium paragraf. P(A|B) = P(B|A)
        âˆ™ P(A) / P(B). Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since 
        the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
        make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
        like Aldus PageMaker including 
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.
